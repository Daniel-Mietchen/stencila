In essence **rPNG** is an image in a PNG format, that has the source code/text embedded into it => ReproduciblePNG

This is Stencilaâ€™s approach to bridging the gap between reproducible documents and legacy formats
- Static images and figures containing code
- Generated by encoda for non-executable file formats (Google Docs, Word files, PDFs)
- Enables back-and-forth conversion between executable and non-executable formats
