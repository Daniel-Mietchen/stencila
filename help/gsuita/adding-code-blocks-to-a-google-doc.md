## Overview

To be able to execute and insert code into your Google document the basic workflow consists of:
- Create a Block, either a Code or an Equation block
- Run the Block in the sidebar
- Insert the results into the document.

## Before you start

We presume you have already:
- Signed up to **Stencila**. If you haven't signed up yet, see [creating an account](../hub/getting-started.md). 

- Installed the **Stencila for Google Docs** add on and open the side bar.

## Create a project

In order to have the right library versions and make use of data files, you need to link your Google Doc to an existing Stencila Hub project or **create a new project**. Give your project a name, tick if you want the project to be public (otherwise it will automatically be set as private) and **Create Project**.

## Start creating

Now that the document is linked as a project source, you can create either a Code Block, or an Equation Block for writing LaTeX equations.
Click **Code** to create a new block.

This view is split into three parts. At the top is the Toolbar, from here you can:
- Run the code block
- Insert it into the document
- Discard changes
*The insert into document and discard change buttons will appear after you‚Äôve run the code block*.

## Code Editor

This is the **Code Editor**. You can configure the programming language and type code in the editor.

## Output preview

At the bottom is the **Output Preview**. Results from running your code block will be shown here. Inserting images in the document is relatively slow, so this lets you quickly iterate on your visualization.

## Let's write some code

First select the programming language from the dropdown. 
- Bash
- JavaScript
- Python
- R

Then enter some code in the top of the code editor box. (Here‚Äôs a simple R code for you to enter: **head(mtcars)**)
When ready, click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Play/Run) button at the right edge of the blue toolbar.

This is the *preview* of running your code, it‚Äôs not part of the document yet. *Be patient as it might take a few seconds*.

When ready, click the **Insert into Document** (Save) button in the toolbar.

You are now embedding the source code into the image, and inserting it into the document. This keeps everything nice and reproducible ü§ñ
