This guide presumes you have already:
1. [Created a project](./create-a-project.md) 
2. [Uploaded a file](../sources/upload.md) to your project and pulled the source. 

## Select your main file

1. Search and select a project you want to publish from and select **Files**.

2. The file you wish to publish must be the **main file**. If you named a file _Read Me_ or _Main_ it will automatically be selected, otherwise, you can manually do this.  Click Main file from the action menu of your chosen file.

The main file is effectively the home page for your project. Looking ahead, when someone visits your project, you want them to view this document.

## Create a snapshot

You've selected your main file and are ready to take a **snapshot**.

A **snapshot** takes a copy of all the files within your project at that particular time. It's effectively creating a saved version. 
When you take a snapshot it converts your main file to a HTML with a dedicated domain on the Stencila hub ie.  youraccountname/projectname.stencila.io. 
You may end up taking several snapshots and they will be numbered sequentially such as V1, V2... Overtime you may wish to **pin** a selected snapshot through your project settings.

Congratulations üëè you‚Äôve just converted your source to an editable manuscript and can preview your document straight away ü§ñ

Notice the project specific URL which has been created and you can [Share](./share-a-project.md).  You can also **Download** the document to your computer or **Open** the document where you can find and replace any static figures in the article with Code Chunks before submitting for publishing.  

## Project settings
Review your [Project Settings](./project-settings.md) to learn how content is served for this project and chosen your favorite project **theme**; a special feature of Stencila.
