Once you're [set up](../getting-started.md) as a Stencila account user decide whether you want to create a project under your personal account or [under your organization](../organizations/create-an-organization.md). The advance of creating an organization is so that a collection of user accounts that be associated with it and work collaboratively on projects.

## Create a project
Navigate to **projects** on the top header bar.

Create a **project name**. All lower case and unique for your account. Note it will be used in the URLs. e.g. https://hub.stenci.la/awesome-org/great-project

Your project will automatically be **private** which means that only you can view it.  Click if you want your project to be **public** for all Stencila users to view.

As the creator of the project you automatically become the project **owner**. This gives you full authority to make changes or delete the project.

Before you start [managing your project sources](./manage-project-source.md) we recommend you finalise your project set up. It won't take a moment. :wink:

## Project settings

**Description** - click **settings** on the left hand side bar and insert a project description if you want to include more information.

**Theme** - We want your published articles to look beautiful, branded and pleasant to read. :sparkles: 

If you haven't already selected your theme we have a range of design themes to choose from and you can preview them all at https://stencila.github.io/thema. 

Once chosen, you are still able to make edits and changes to the theme if you want to. You can also choose another theme at an time. 

Through **settings** scroll down to **Content** and click **Theme** to select your template and **Upload**.

If you choose to leave this section untouched the default style theme assigned to your projects with be the **Stencila** theme.
