Once you're [set up](../getting-started.md) as a Stencila user you can create your a project.  

Before you get started decide whether you want to create the project under your personal account or [under your organization](./organizations/create-an-organization.md). 

Click **projects** on the header bar.

If you have previously set up, or joined, your organization you can choose whether the project is under your personal or your company's account.

Create a project name. All lower case and unique for your account. Note it will be used in the URLs. e.g. https://hub.stenci.la/awesome-org/great-project

Your project will automatically be **private**.  Click if you want your project to be **public**.

Before you get working on your project we recommend you finalise your project set up. It won't take a moment. :wink:

## Set up

**Description** - click **settings** and add a project description if you want. 
**Theme** - Use the default Stencila theme or choose from one of the templates. Preview them all at https://stencila.github.io/thema.
