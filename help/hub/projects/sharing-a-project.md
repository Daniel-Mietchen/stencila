description: Invite other users to collaborate on your project
---
If you'd like to share your project with others simply click **sharing** on the left hand side bar.

Type the name of the person you wish to share with. If they are already a Stencila user their name will appear. You can assign then as either an **author**, **manager** or **owner**.  Click **add**.

If the person you wish to share with does not come up in the search then simply invite them to sign up via this link - https://hub.stenci.la/. 
*In time we hope you will be able to invite new users from within your account*. 

To **remove someone** from your project simply click at the end of their name in the search bar and remove.
