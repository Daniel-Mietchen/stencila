As soon as you have [created a project](./create-a-project.md) you can invite other users to work collaboratively with you.

Click **sharing** on the left hand side bar.

Type the name of the person you wish to share your project with and **add**. If they are already a Stencila user their name will appear.

You can assign then as either an **author**, **manager** or **owner**.

**Author**:  can create and update.

**Manager**: as for author and can create, update and delete teams.

**Owner**: as for manager and can also add and remove users and change their role.

If the person you wish to share your project with doesn't come up in the search you can invite them to sign up as a user via this link - https://hub.stenci.la/. 

**Feature upgrade** - In time we hope you can invite new users from within your account.
