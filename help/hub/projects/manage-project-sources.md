Once you've [created a project](./create-a-project.md) and updated your settings to [choose your theme](../organizations/manage-organization-settings.md) you are ready to start working.

Within your project click **New** and choose from the drop down menu.

## Upload a file

You can [upload a file](../sources/upload.md) directly from your computer to your Stencila project to use within the project's executable documents. The files are managed on Stencila servers and do not need to be pulled.

## Link a source

In addition to uploading files to a project, you can link to sources that are hosted elsewhere.
* [URL Source](../sources/upload.md)
* [Google Docs Source](../sources/google-docs.md)
* [Google Drive Source](../sources/google-drive.md) 
* [GitHub Source](../sources/url.md)

These sources remain on the external service, but a versioned copy is downloaded (pulled) and stored with your project to maintain reproducibility. When you start a compute session to run your project, we will mount the pulled files into the session.

You can go to the sources tab of your project at any time to update the local copies of your source files by **pulling** them.

A **path** is the name that the file or directory from the source is mapped to in the project.

Once created you can perform various tasks.

Once converted to your chosen format you can perform various tasks. For example you might wish to download a file to enrich it and then upload it.
