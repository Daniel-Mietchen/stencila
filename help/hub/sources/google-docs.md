You can add a Google Doc as a source within your Stencila project.

Before you start make sure your google account is connected to your Stencila account. To check, go to your account **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen, scroll to the bottom of the page and under **Other** click **Account Connections**.

## Creating a Google Doc source

To add a Google Doc as a project source:

1. Go to the project **Sources** page

3. Enter the **Doc id** by copy and pasting the document URL or link. Add the **Path** that you want to link it to within the project (what you want to name your source) and **Create Source**

## Your Google Doc source

Your Google Doc source is automatically "pulled" into your project and stores in your project's working directory.

## Refresh your source

You can **pull** the file again at any time to refresh the content.
