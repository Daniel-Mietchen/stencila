You can add a GitHub repository as a source within your Stencila project.

Before you start make sure your GitHub account is connected to your Stencila account. To check, go to your account **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen, scroll to the bottom of the page and under **Other** click **Account Connections**.

## Creating a GitHub source

To add a GitHub repository as a project source:

1. Go to the project **Sources** page

## Pull your GitHub source

Your Github repository is automatically "pulled" into your project and stores in your project's working directory.

## Refresh your source

You can **pull** the file/s again at any time to refresh the content.
