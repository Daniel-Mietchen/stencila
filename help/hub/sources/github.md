You can link a GitHub repository to your project as a source. This allows you to take full advantage of all of GitHub's great source code management, version control and collaboration and to easily pull this information into your Stencila project.

## Before you start

Before you start make sure your GitHub account is connected to your Stencila account. To check, go to your account **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen, scroll to the bottom of the page and under **Other** click **Account Connections**.

## Create a GitHub source

To add a GitHub repository as a project source:

* Go to the project **Sources** page

* Enter the repository **name** and **subpath** directly

* Or the **URL**

* Add the **Path** that you want to link it to within the project (what you want to name your source)

Your Github repository is automatically **pulled** into your project and stores in your project's working directory.

## Refresh

You can **pull** the file again at any time to refresh the content.
