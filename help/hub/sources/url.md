A URL source lets you pull content from a website or API into your project. Useful when you wish to fetch and analysis data such as from data repositories or Github. Quite often these are CSV files.

## Creating an URL source

To add an URL as a project source:

* Go to the project **Sources** page

* Enter the source **URL** and the **Path** that you want to link it to within the project (what you want to name your source) and **Create Source**

Your URL source is automatically **pulled** into your project and stores in your project's working directory.

## Refresh

You can **pull** the file again at any time to refresh the content.
