/**
 * Module for installing Encoda native modules and executables
 *
 * The [`pkg`](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) Node.js packager does not
 * package native modules.  i.e `*.node` files. There are various ways to handle this but
 * we found the easiest/safest was to simply copy the directories for the
 * packages with native modules, from the host system, into directory where the
 * binary is installed. This script does that via `encoda-deps.tar.gz` which is
 * packaged in the binary snapshot as an `asset`.
 *
 * See:
 *   - https://github.com/stencila/encoda/pull/47#issuecomment-489912132
 *   - https://github.com/zeit/pkg/issues/329
 *   - https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/173
 *   - `package.json`
